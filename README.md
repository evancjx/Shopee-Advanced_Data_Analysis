# Shopee-Advanced_Data_Analysis
With Python and mainly Pandas Library

*Disclaimer: Not able to upload the dataset as I do not have the permission to.

About 9 months ago, I attended Shopee's Workshop in Advanced Data Analysis using Python

This repository is to revisit the workshop work and to potentially do it better.

## Some Terminology
3PL: Third-Party Logistics providers<br>
CDT: Courier Deliver Time<br>
Pickup/delivery volume: No. of parcels picked up/delievered by 3PL (in a given time)<br>
Delivery Backlog: No. of parcels pending delivery by 3PL<br>
Late Delivery rate: Percentage of parcels delivered beyond agreed service level<br>

## Logistics Analysis
1. Recognize when there are 3PL performnce issues
2. Assist in investigating poor 3PL performance<br>
    Cross-sectional analysis to identify key sectors contributing to poor performance<br>
    E.g. Spatial analysis / Time-series analysis<br>
    Device solutions for improvement and evaluate effectiveness<br>
    E.g. Simulations using hisotrical data<br>

## Task
1. Identify worst (and best) performing states for each metric (spatial analysis)
2. Identify worst (and best) performing periods (weeks/days) for each metric (temporal analysis)
3. Identify any variation by day of week in 3PL performance for each metric (seasonality)
